# UAlbertaVISUAL's Website

Welcome to the **VISUAL (Video, Image, Signal Understanding and Learning) Laboratory** at the University of Alberta. Led by **Dr. Nilanjan Ray**, our lab is a part of the Department of Computing Science.

### Our Mission
We are dedicated to advancing the frontiers of computer vision, image analysis, and visual recognition. Our research leverages deep learning and continuous optimization to solve complex problems in:

* **Medical Imaging:** Automated segmentation and tracking in MRI, CT, and other modalities.
* **Visual Recognition:** Object detection, tracking, and semantic segmentation.
* **ADEPT:** Developing Architectures for Differentiable End-to-end Programming and Training.

We bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning and practical, high-impact applications in healthcare and autonomous systems.
