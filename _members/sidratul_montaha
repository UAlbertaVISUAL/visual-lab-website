I am Sidratul Montaha, a PhD student in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging.
My current work focuses on applying machine learning to cardiac MRI to reduce the number of imaging sequences required for accurate assessment of right ventricular function, with the goal of shortening scan time while maintaining reliable estimation of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF).
