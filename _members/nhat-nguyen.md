I am a PhD student working with Dr. Nilanjan Ray and Dr. Pierre Boulanger on applications of information geometry and optimal transport to problems in computer vision and quantum error correction.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my MSc under the supervision of Dr. Nilanjan Ray, focusing on differentiable programming methods for medical imaging. I also spent several years in industry conducting research on physics-based machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and control.

My research interests broadly include optimization and control, with particular emphasis on geometric and transport-based methods for practical, application-driven problems in vision and quantum systems.
