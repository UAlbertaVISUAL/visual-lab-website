I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Nilanjan Ray and Dr. Gilbert Bigras on improving biomarker detection in digital pathology images with deep learning to assist pathologists in performing better cancer diagnoses and prognoses.

Dr. Ray also supervised my PhD work, which I completed in 2025. My doctoral thesis was mostly about object detection and segmentation with language modeling, though I also spent some years working on multi-object tracking.
Prior to that, I did my MSc work with Dr. Martin Jagersand on high precision registration-based 2D tracking in natural images and its application to uncalibrated visual servoing. 

My research interests include all aspects of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, though I am particularly interested in the application of deep learning to vision problems like object detection, segmentation and tracking.
