I am a master's student in the Computing Science Department at the University of Alberta, with a background in Systems and Biomedical Engineering. 
My research interests sit at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, medical imaging, and biosignal analytics, with a focus on cardiac MRI segmentation and multimodal monitoring using wearable devices.
