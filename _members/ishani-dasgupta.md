Ishani DasGupta is a PhD candidate at the Department of Computing Science, working under the supervision of Prof. Nilanjan Ray and Prof. Kumaradevan Punithakumar. Her work integrates medical image analysis and machine learning. The research aims to leverage neural networks to automate the segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) from 3D echocardiography images, for faster and more reliable cardiac analysis.
Beyond medical imaging, she is interested in data analytics and microfluidics as complementary research areas.
Outside of research, she enjoys photography, cooking, and reading.
