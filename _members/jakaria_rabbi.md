I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. My research focuses on 3D medical shape analysis and interpretable representation learning, with an emphasis on disentangling clinically meaningful factors from anatomical surface geometry. I develop geometry-aware deep learning methods for implicit neural representations and mesh/graph models, combining supervised, unsupervised, and weakly supervised learning. My goal is to build robust, label-efficient shape biomarkers for neurological and musculoskeletal diseases.
