I am a computer vision researcher in my master’s thesis in computing science. 
I joined the VISUAL lab and ALSNIRU lab in 2025 in cross-disciplinary research towards MRI image analysis for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
In my research, I apply deep learning to volumetric MRI scans, and create normative models of the brain for neurodegenerative disease detection.
I also create projects with AI for health tech and clean energy tech. Outside of academia, I am an accomplished dancer, esports coach, and cat dad.
